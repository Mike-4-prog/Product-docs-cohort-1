###  Finding Your First Issue
Ready to contribute? Great! Here’s how to find your first task:

1. Browse Bug_Report Labeled Tickets
Open the [openMadness Issues](https://github.com/Mike-4-prog/Product-docs-cohort-1/blob/Product-docs-cohort-1-Group3/.github/issue_template/) tab , and filter by the label `bug_report.md`. These are beginner-friendly and well-defined tasks perfect for newcomers.
2. Check the Roadmap
Want something bigger? Explore our [Roadmap](https://github.com/Mike-4-prog/Product-docs-cohort-1/blob/Product-docs-cohort-1-Group3/README.md) to see where we’re headed and what features we’re planning next.

3. Suggest New Ideas
Have a wild idea for an array utility no one has thought of yet? Open a new issue with the title “Feature Idea: [Your Idea]” and start the conversation.

:::note
Always comment on the issue saying **you’d like to take it** before starting work. That way, we can avoid duplicate efforts.

### Making Your Contribution
Now it’s time to write some code! Follow these best practices:

1. Create a New Branch
Always work in a separate branch:
```js
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
Use descriptive names like `feature/array-shuffle` or `bugfix/filter-bug`.

2. Write Clean, Well-Documented Code
Follow the coding standards outlined in the project’s CONTRIBUTING.md . All new functions must include:

- JSDoc-style comments
- TypeScript types (if applicable)
- Inline examples in comments
3. Add Tests
Every contribution needs corresponding tests. Use Jest syntax and place tests in the appropriate folder inside `/test`.

4. Update Documentation
If your change affects usage, update the relevant documentation files and/or add a new guide in `/docs`.

### Submitting Your Pull Request (PR)
When you’re ready to share your work:

1. Commit Your Changes
Use clear, concise commit messages:

```js
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat(array): add shuffle method"
```
2. Push to Your Fork
Push your branch to GitHub:

```js
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
3. Open a Pull Request
Go to the main openMadness repository and click `“Compare & pull request.”` Fill out the [PR template](https://github.com/Mike-4-prog/Product-docs-cohort-1/blob/Product-docs-cohort-1-Group3/.github/pull_request_template/pull_request.md) with:

- A clear title
- A detailed description of what you did
- Any issues your PR resolves
- Screenshots or console logs if helpful

**We’ll review it as soon as possible!**
