# Introduction

`omArray` is a specialised javascript object that wraps an array of numbers. 

Using `omArray` is different from using a regular javascript array in the following ways:

- **Less repetition**: In regular arrays, you need to write code to make calculations. In omArray, common data properties such as ‘max’, ‘min’ or ‘length’ are instantly available without needing to write code. 
- **Fewer bugs**: miscalculations can occur in regular arrays because code is written manually.  Using `omArray`'s inbuilt functions, produces accurate calculations every time.
- **Inbuilt functionality**: With a regular array, you need to remember or look up how to do things, with `omArray`, you can explore all the inbuilt properties available.
- **Improved readability**: `omArray` is easier to read than the complex calculations in regular arrays.
- **Added functionality**: With `omArray` you can add functionality to your code without changing it. `omArray` will produce new outputs and won’t modify the original code.
