# Introduction to Openmadness

Openmadness is a modern JavaScript library crafted to simplify array and mathematical operations, making numerical programming more accessible and intuitive for developers at any level. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or early-career developer, Openmadness provides a clean and expressive toolkit for working with data and numbers in JavaScript.

Inspired by the philosophy of libraries like NumPy (but built entirely for the JavaScript ecosystem), Openmadness brings simplicity, speed, and readability to numerical operations without requiring heavy dependencies or complex setups.
