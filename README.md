## 🚀 Getting Started (For Group 3 Members)

All work for our group will be organized under this branch:  
`Product-docs-cohort-1-Group3`

Each member will:

1. Clone the main repo
2. Switch to the group branch
3. Create a personal sub-branch for their assigned docs
4. Work and push their task
5. Open a pull request

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Clone the main repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Technical-writing-mentorship-program/Product-docs-cohort-1.git
cd Product-docs-cohort-1
```


### 2. Fetch and switch to the Group 3 branch
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout Product-docs-cohort-1-Group3
```


### 3. Create your personal task branch
Replace your-name-task with something descriptive:
```bash
git checkout -b your-name-task
```


#### Example for a teammate called Jane working on Essentials:
```bash
git checkout -b jane-essentials-docs
```


### 4. Make your documentation edits
Navigate to:

```bash
src/content/docs/guides/
```

Add or edit your assigned file (e.g., essentials.md, introduction.md, etc.)

### 5. Stage and commit your changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Essentials guide for Openmadness"
```


### 6. Push your task branch to GitHub
```bash
git push origin jane-essentials-docs
```



### 7. Open a Pull Request
Go to the repository on GitHub and:

Base branch: Product-docs-cohort-1-Group3

Compare branch: your sub-branch (e.g., jane-essentials-docs)

Add a clear title and a short description of what you did

### 8. Notes
Do NOT push directly to the group branch.

Always work in a personal sub-branch and open a Pull Request for merging.

Ask the group lead for a review if unsure about structure or content.

Happy documenting! 💻📖
